Database Setup:
Step 1: Download database MySQL workbench, and set up the database ( internet materials)
Step 2: Check in server the file connectDB.js and make the connection (username : root, password : admin) in MySQL. 
Step 3: Run file SQL fullQuery first, and then run procedure.sql (I attached in the project for initializing database).
Notice: the usernames and passwords of users are stored in tbl_user table. (default username is username in tbl_user table, default password is id in tbl_user table)/

Server Setup:
The user should follow my instructions below: 
Step 1: The user needs to install the npm package and nodeJS on his or her computer. You can see the instructions at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. 
Step 2: The user should pull my code from my GitHub (I put it in reference). 
Step 3: The user should install some extensions in VS Code, such as Babel JavaScript, JS6 Code Snippets, and the REST client. 
Step 4: The user opens his or her terminal (ctrl + shift + ` ) and goes to the root path. Then they run the command npm install -i. 
Step 5: The user should split the terminal because my project runs on two different ports. Then the user goes to the server and runs two commands on each terminal: npm run auth and npm run dev.
